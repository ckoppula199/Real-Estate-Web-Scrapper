# Real-Estate-Web-Scrapper

Created this web scraper as I am currently looking for apartments to rent in London for my second year at UCL. By web scrapping the site rightmove, I was able to find, in a relativley short amount of time, over 100 properties that fit my criteria. The script first obtains the html script for the first page and then extracts smaller parts of that html script based on some criteria such as <div> tags only for example. I then got data for all properties that had 3 bedrooms, were under Â£580 a week, and were in the NW1 area. I then stored all this information into a pandas DataFrame. I manipulated that dataframe, which initially just contained data for all properties on the site, to only contain properties that fit my criteria. I then exported this to a csv file which can then be opened in excel. I used the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries to accomplish this.
